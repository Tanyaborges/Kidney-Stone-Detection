# Kidney-Stone-Detection
Kidney stones are pieces of solid material that occur in the urinary tract and can cause severe pain in the abdomen if the treatment gets delayed. Here, I have made a tool to detect the presence of a kidney stone using an ultrasound image so that a doctor can treat you. This was achieved by denoising and enhancing the ultrasound using various filters like Gaussian Blur, Median Blur, Laplacian Filter, and Gabor Filter. For improving the contrast in the image, I have used Adaptive Histogram Equalization. For the separation of shadow from stone, I used Watershed Segmentation. Further, marking is done to label the stone.
